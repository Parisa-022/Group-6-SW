> But definitely check the ST-link drivers cuz we need then to flash(upload) the program to the mainboard.

## Setup

After you have installed the IDE, please follow the steps below to properly setup your **Integrated Development Environment**

Download the code boilerplate we prepared for you from Github [release](https://github.com/HKUST-Robotics-Team/HKUST-Robotics-Team-SW-Tutorial-2021/releases/tag/code).
_Note that we may have some library changes from time to time. So always follow what the tutorial notes say._

### Import the project files

## Troubleshooting

> If somehow it says *Program file does not exist*, you can click Search Project and select the correct .elf file. In our case, `Release/SW Tutorial 2021.elf`.
### More configuration on the IDE

Since STMCubeIDE is based on Eclipse, you can configure the theme, keybindings, formatter and more.

> What I have configured:
>
> - Dark theme
> - Clang-formatter
> - Auto-complete
> - VSCode keybindings

### Explore the IDE if you have time!
